        <h2>STUDIO 1 - Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <date>1/31/2025</date>
        <p>
            Modals, also known as overlays or dialogs, were originally created to simplify user interfaces and save screen space. However, they have become overused and often annoy users, much like old pop-up ads. This article explains when and how to use modals properly to improve user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            A modal is a window that appears on top of the main page, blocking interaction with the rest of the site until the user responds. Modals are useful for grabbing attention, collecting user input (like login forms), or showing extra information without leaving the page. However, they should not be used for error messages, success notifications, or mobile devices, as they can disrupt user flow.
        </p>

        <p>
            To create effective modals, designers should follow key guidelines. A modal should always have an easy way to close it, such as a cancel button, an "X" button, or clicking outside the window. The title should clearly explain the purpose of the modal, and buttons should be labeled in a way that avoids confusion. The modal should be sized appropriately—not too big or too small—and placed in the upper half of the screen for better visibility. A lightbox effect (dimming the background) helps focus attention on the modal.
        </p>

        <p>
            While modals can be helpful, designers should think carefully before using them. If users instinctively close modals without reading them, they may not be the best choice. Instead, alternatives like non-modal toasts can provide important information without interrupting the user experience.

        <h2>STUDIO 1 - Research Form Design</h2>
        <date>1/21/2025</date>
        <p>
            Designing forms is an important part of creating user-friendly websites and apps, and getting it right can really help increase conversions. Looking at the best practices for form design, I’ve learned that keeping things simple and clear is key. Reducing unnecessary fields and complexity makes forms easier for users to fill out. Using a single-column layout is especially helpful for keeping the process smooth, particularly on mobile devices.

        </p>

        <p>
            What really stood out to me about the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">article</a> is how important it is to make forms accessible to everyone. It’s not just about making the form look nice but also making sure people with different abilities can use it easily. Features like clear error messages, compatibility with screen readers, and options to adjust text size are essential.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also realized how the design choices can affect user behavior. For example, asking easy questions first builds momentum, and showing a progress bar for multi-step forms keeps users engaged. Every detail, from labels to button design, can improve the overall experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            The new <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"target="_blank">FAFSA form</a> that came out in 2024 is such an improvement. It's a lot shorter, which saved me a lot of time, and the language used is a lot more casual, making it less intimidating to fill out.
