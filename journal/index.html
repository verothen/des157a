            Designing forms is an important part of creating user-friendly websites and apps, and getting it right can really help increase conversions. Looking at the best practices for form design, I’ve learned that keeping things simple and clear is key. Reducing unnecessary fields and complexity makes forms easier for users to fill out. Using a single-column layout is especially helpful for keeping the process smooth, particularly on mobile devices.

            What really stood out to me about the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">article</a> is how important it is to make forms accessible to everyone. It’s not just about making the form look nice but also making sure people with different abilities can use it easily. Features like clear error messages, compatibility with screen readers, and options to adjust text size are essential.

            I also realized how the design choices can affect user behavior. For example, asking easy questions first builds momentum, and showing a progress bar for multi-step forms keeps users engaged. Every detail, from labels to button design, can improve the overall experience.

            The new <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"target="_blank">FAFSA form</a> that came out in 2024 is such an improvement. It's a lot shorter, which saved me a lot of time, and the language used is a lot more casual, making it less intimidating to fill out.
